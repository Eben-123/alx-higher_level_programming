# Python - Classes and Objects
## Background Context
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.
**Classes** an abstract blueprint used to create more specific, concrete objects. Classes often represent broad categories, like man or man that share attributes.


##Project
